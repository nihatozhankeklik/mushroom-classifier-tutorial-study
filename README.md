# Mushroom Classifier â€“ Study Project

This is a guided study and practice project based on a Google Colab notebook for classifying mushroom species using image processing techniques in Python.

The goal of this project is to explore basic image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification methods using OpenCV. This project was not fully developed from scratch but was reconstructed for educational purposes as part of my learning process.

## Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
